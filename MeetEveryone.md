I mentioned that I wanted to have a chat with everyone at XYZ Co to understand how things are going, does this time suit you for this?

The meeting agenda is the same for everyone; a quick intro and then the following questions (I'll go through this in the meeting too):

- Who do you go to for advice and bouncing ideas off

- What do you think the most important things we should be doing over the next year?

- What will get in the way of us doing that?

- What’s going well, i.e. what should we make sure we don’t change?

- Is there anything you think I should know about?
