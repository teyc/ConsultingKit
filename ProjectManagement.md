# Heilmeier Catechism

George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director (1975-1977), crafted a set of questions known as the "Heilmeier Catechism" to help Agency officials think through and evaluate proposed research programs.

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
- What are the risks?
- How much will it cost?
- How long will it take?
- What are the mid-term and final “exams” to check for success?

# Battle-tested format for presentation

If you’re presenting to your manager, leadership team, or an executive trying to convince them to make a call, I have a presentation format for you to follow.

It's battle tested so you get to avoid my earlier mistakes.

1. **Start with the conclusion.**

   I used to think TED talk-like presentations that lead you to the conclusions are the way to go. Not in this case.

   Be clear about why you’re there, what are you expecting from them, and what problem are you solving. That’s slide #1.
   
2. ** What’s the problem you’re solving and why does it matter?**

   If you can't get people in the room on the same page about why this problem is critical to the company, it's going to be difficult for you to move forward.

   You want agreement that this is a problem that matters. 

3. **What are we currently doing about this problem?**
   Don't skip this part. There is likely *something* that the company is doing now to solve this issue. Even if you disagree with it, mention it.

   Make it clear you understand what is our current approach. 

4. W**hat are our competitors or industry leaders doing?**

   If other companies in your industry are solving this issue better, highlight that.

   This is powerful. Nobody wants to fall behind and highlighting how others are doing better is a powerful motivation to do more. 

5. **What’s your solution?**

   Now that we're clear on the problem and have similar context, what is your solution?

   If this is a slight repeat of slide #1, that's okay. You want to highlight it within the context you've just provided. 

6. **What's the cost?**

   Solutions cost money and resources. What are you asking for? You want to be clear and articulate about the overall cost of this solution.

   This is not just about money, it’s about the overall cost of time, possible change of direction, resourcing, etc. 

7. **What’s the cost of inaction?**

   Do *not* skip this part.

   There is a cost to doing nothing. This is a killer way to showcase how the cost of doing something is *better* than the cost of doing what we're doing today or to not improve. 

8. **What’s your high-level execution plan?**

   Depending on who you're presenting to, you might not have to show too much detail here.

   However, you want to be clear that this is not a pie in the sky idea. You've thought this through and have a plan of action if this goes forward. 

9. **The action items**

   What decision do you expect to be made in this room? Who's responsible for what decisions? What is blocked on these decisions?

   Be clear about your ask(s). You want to leave the room either with a decision or with a clear path to one.
